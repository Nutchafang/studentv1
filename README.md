Student Attention

Business Problem
In online learning environments, teachers are unable to effectively assess
students’ attention and engagement levels.
This makes it difficult for teachers to adjust teaching methods and respond
to student needs in a timely manner.


Objective
The objective of this project is to provide teachers with summarized insights
into student attention levels, enabling them to make better-informed
teaching decisions.


Solution Overview
The solution is a system that receives video data from online classes,
analyzes student behavior, and transforms the results into clear and
easy-to-understand insights for teachers.


Process Flow
The overall workflow consists of four main steps:
1.Users interact with the system through a web interface.
2.The system sends the data to the backend for processing.
3.The backend analyzes and computes attention-related results.
4.The results are returned and displayed on the web interface in an
easy-to-understand format.


Business Value
- Helps teachers spot disengaged students quickly.
- Provides metrics instead of manual observation.
- Can be extended for analytics dashboards or alerts.
