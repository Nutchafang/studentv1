# Student Attention Analysis System

# Business Problem
In online learning environments, teachers are unable to effectively assess
students’ attention and engagement levels.
This makes it difficult for teachers to adjust teaching methods and respond
to student needs in a timely manner.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to provide teachers with summarized insights
into student attention levels, enabling them to make better-informed
teaching decisions.

# Solution Overview
The solution is a system that receives video data from online classes,
analyzes student behavior, and transforms the results into clear and
easy-to-understand insights for teachers.

# Process Flow
The overall workflow consists of four main steps:
1. Users access the system through a web interface and upload or stream class video data.
2. The video data is sent to the backend system for processing.
3. The backend analyzes student behavior and calculates attention metrics.
4. The analyzed results are sent back and displayed on the web interface in a clear and easy-to-understand format.

# Business Value
- Helps teachers quickly identify disengaged students.
- Provides objective metrics instead of manual observation.
- Can be extended to support analytics dashboards or alert systems.
